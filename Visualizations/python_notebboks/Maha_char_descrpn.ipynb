       "'ADI PARVA/tII\\tII\\n\\n\"The Rishis said, \\'O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and\\ncircumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.\\'\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter\\nO ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as\\nSamanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas,\\nRama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by\\nimpatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And\\nwhen that fiery meteor, by his own valour, annihilated the entire tribe\\nof the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood. We\\nare told that his reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations\\nof blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the\\nsanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom\\nRichika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, \\'O Rama, O\\nblessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the\\nreverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour, O mighty\\none! Blessings be upon thee. O thou illustrious one, ask the boon that\\nthou mayst desire.\\'\\n\\n\"Rama said, \\'If, O fathers, ye are favourably disposed towards me, the\\nboon I ask is that I may be absolved from the sins born of my having\\nannihilated the Kshatriyas in anger, and that the lakes I have formed may\\nbecome famous in the world as holy shrines.\\' The Pitris then said, \\'So\\nshall it be. But be thou pacified.\\' And Rama was pacified accordingly.\\nThe region that lieth near unto those lakes of gory water, from that time\\nhath been celebrated as Samanta-panchaka the holy. The wise have declared\\nthat every country should be distinguished by a name significant of some\\ncircumstance which may have rendered it famous. In the interval between\\nthe Dwapara and the Kali Yugas there happened at Samanta-panchaka the\\nencounter between the armies of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. In that\\nholy region, without ruggedness of any kind, were assembled eighteen\\nAkshauhinis of soldiers eager for battle. And, O Brahmanas, having come\\nthereto, they were all slain on the spot. Thus the name of that region, O\\nBrahmanas, hath been explained, and the country described to you as a\\nsacred and delightful one. I have mentioned the whole of what relateth to\\nit as the region is celebrated throughout the three worlds.\\'\\n\\n\"The Rishis said, \\'We have a desire to know, O son of Suta, what is\\nimplied by the term Akshauhini that hath been used by thee. Tell us in\\nfull what is the number of horse and foot, chariots and elephants, which\\ncompose an Akshauhini for thou art fully informed.\\'\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'One chariot, one elephant, five foot-soldiers, and three\\nhorses form one Patti; three pattis make one Sena-mukha; three\\nsena-mukhas are called a Gulma; three gulmas, a Gana; three ganas, a\\nVahini; three vahinis together are called a Pritana; three pritanas form\\na Chamu; three chamus, one Anikini; and an anikini taken ten times forms,\\nas it is styled by those who know, an Akshauhini. O ye best of Brahmanas,\\narithmeticians have calculated that the number of chariots in an\\nAkshauhini is twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy. The measure\\nof elephants must be fixed at the same number. O ye pure, you must know\\nthat the number of foot-soldiers is one hundred and nine thousand, three\\nhundred and fifty, the number of horse is sixty-five thousand, six\\nhundred and ten. These, O Brahmanas, as fully explained by me, are the\\nnumbers of an Akshauhini as said by those acquainted with the principles\\nof numbers. O best of Brahmanas, according to this calculation were\\ncomposed the eighteen Akshauhinis of the Kaurava and the Pandava army.\\nTime, whose acts are wonderful assembled them on that spot and having\\nmade the Kauravas the cause, destroyed them all. Bhishma acquainted with\\nchoice of weapons, fought for ten days. Drona protected the Kaurava\\nVahinis for five days. Kama the desolator of hostile armies fought for\\ntwo days; and Salya for half a day. After that lasted for half a day the\\nencounter with clubs between Duryodhana and Bhima. At the close of that\\nday, Aswatthaman and Kripa destroyed the army of Yudishthira in the night\\nwhile sleeping without suspicion of danger.\\n\\n\\'O Saunaka, this best of narrations called Bharata which has begun to be\\nrepeated at thy sacrifice, was formerly repeated at the sacrifice of\\nJanamejaya by an intelligent disciple of Vyasa. It is divided into\\nseveral sections; in the beginning are Paushya, Pauloma, and Astika\\nparvas, describing in full the valour and renown of kings. It is a work\\nwhose description, diction, and sense are varied and wonderful. It\\ncontains an account of various manners and rites. It is accepted by the\\nwise, as the state called Vairagya is by men desirous of final release.\\nAs Self among things to be known, as life among things that are dear, so\\nis this history that furnisheth the means of arriving at the knowledge of\\nBrahma the first among all the sastras. There is not a story current in\\nthis world but doth depend upon this history even as the body upon the\\nfoot that it taketh. As masters of good lineage are ever attended upon by\\nservants desirous of preferment so is the Bharata cherished by all poets.\\nAs the words constituting the several branches of knowledge appertaining\\nto the world and the Veda display only vowels and consonants, so this\\nexcellent history displayeth only the highest wisdom.\\n\\n\\'Listen, O ye ascetics, to the outlines of the several divisions (parvas)\\nof this history called Bharata, endued with great wisdom, of sections and\\nfeet that are wonderful and various, of subtile meanings and logical\\nconnections, and embellished with the substance of the Vedas.\\n\\n\\'The first parva is called Anukramanika; the second, Sangraha; then\\nPaushya; then Pauloma; the Astika; then Adivansavatarana. Then comes the\\nSambhava of wonderful and thrilling incidents. Then comes Jatugrihadaha\\n(setting fire to the house of lac) and then Hidimbabadha (the killing of\\nHidimba) parvas; then comes Baka-badha (slaughter of Baka) and then\\nChitraratha. The next is called Swayamvara (selection of husband by\\nPanchali), in which Arjuna by the exercise of Kshatriya virtues, won\\nDraupadi for wife. Then comes Vaivahika (marriage). Then comes\\nViduragamana (advent of Vidura), Rajyalabha (acquirement of kingdom),\\nArjuna-banavasa (exile of Arjuna) and Subhadra-harana (the carrying away\\nof Subhadra). After these come Harana-harika, Khandava-daha (the burning\\nof the Khandava forest) and Maya-darsana (meeting with Maya the Asura\\narchitect). Then come Sabha, Mantra, Jarasandha, Digvijaya (general\\ncampaign). After Digvijaya come Raja-suyaka, Arghyaviharana (the robbing\\nof the Arghya) and Sisupala-badha (the killing of Sisupala).

Then is narrated the receipt of this intelligence by Bhima from the\\nfowlers: then is narrated how, moved by the insulting speeches of the\\nintelligent Yudhishthira, Duryodhana ever unable to bear affronts, came\\nout of the waters. Then comes the encounter with clubs, between\\nDuryodhana and Bhima; then the arrival, at the time of such encounter, of\\nBalarama: then is described the sacredness of the Saraswati; then the\\nprogress of the encounter with clubs; then the fracture of Duryodhana\\'s\\nthighs in battle by Bhima with (a terrific hurl of) his mace. These all\\nhave been described in the wonderful ninth Parva. In this the number of\\nsections is fifty-nine and the number of slokas composed by the great\\nVyasa--the spreader of the fame of the Kauravas--is three thousand, two\\nhundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"Then shall I describe the Parva called Sauptika of frightful incidents.\\nOn the Pandavas having gone away, the mighty charioteers, Kritavarman,\\nKripa, and the son of Drona, came to the field of battle in the evening\\nand there saw king Duryodhana lying on the ground, his thighs broken, and\\nhimself covered with blood. Then the great charioteer, the son of Drona,\\nof terrible wrath, vowed, \\'without killing all the Panchalas including\\nDrishtadyumna, and the Pandavas also with all their allies, I will not\\ntake off armour.\\' Having spoken those words, the three warriors leaving\\nDuryodhana\\'s side entered the great forest just as the sun was setting.\\nWhile sitting under a large banian tree in the night, they saw an owl\\nkilling numerous crows one after another. At the sight of this,\\nAswatthaman, his heart full of rage at the thought of his father\\'s fate,\\nresolved to slay the slumbering Panchalas. And wending to the gate of the\\ncamp, he saw there a Rakshasa of frightful visage, his head reaching to\\nthe very heavens, guarding the entrance. And seeing that Rakshasa\\nobstructing all his weapons, the son of Drona speedily pacified by\\nworship the three-eyed Rudra. And then accompanied by Kritavarman and\\nKripa he slew all the sons of Draupadi, all the Panchalas with\\nDhrishtadyumna and others, together with their relatives, slumbering\\nunsuspectingly in the night. All perished on that fatal night except the\\nfive Pandavas and the great warrior Satyaki. Those escaped owing to\\nKrishna\\'s counsels, then the charioteer of Dhrishtadyumna brought to the\\nPandavas intelligence of the slaughter of the slumbering Panchalas by the\\nson of Drona. Then Draupadi distressed at the death of her sons and\\nbrothers and father sat before her lords resolved to kill herself by\\nfasting. Then Bhima of terrible prowess, moved by the words of Draupadi,\\nresolved, to please her; and speedily taking up his mace followed in\\nwrath the son of his preceptor in arms. The son of Drona from fear of\\nBhimasena and impelled by the fates and moved also by anger discharged a\\ncelestial weapon saying, \\'This is for the destruction of all the\\nPandavas\\'; then Krishna saying. \\'This shall not be\\', neutralised\\nAswatthaman\\'s speech. Then Arjuna neutralised that weapon by one of his\\nown. Seeing the wicked Aswatthaman\\'s destructive intentions, Dwaipayana\\nand Krishna pronounced curses on him which the latter returned. Pandava\\nthen deprived the mighty warrior-in-chariot Aswatthaman, of the jewel on\\nhis head, and became exceedingly glad, and, boastful of their success,\\nmade a present of it to the sorrowing Draupadi. Thus the tenth Parva,\\ncalled Sauptika, is recited. The great Vyasa hath composed this in\\neighteen sections. The number of slokas also composed (in this) by the\\ngreat reciter of sacred truths is eight hundred and seventy. In this\\nParva has been put together by the great Rishi the two Parvas called\\nSauptika and Aishika.\\n\\n\"After this hath been recited the highly pathetic Parva called Stri,\\nDhritarashtra of prophetic eye, afflicted at the death of his children,\\nand moved by enmity towards Bhima, broke into pieces a statue of hard\\niron deftly placed before him by Krishna (as substitute of Bhima). Then\\nVidura, removing the distressed Dhritarashtra\\'s affection for worldly\\nthings by reasons pointing to final release, consoled that wise monarch.\\nThen hath been described the wending of the distressed Dhritarashtra\\naccompanied by the ladies of his house to the field of battle of the\\nKauravas. Here follow the pathetic wailings of the wives of the slain\\nheroes. Then the wrath of Gandhari and Dhritarashtra and their loss of\\nconsciousness. Then the Kshatriya ladies saw those heroes,--their\\nunreturning sons, brothers, and fathers,--lying dead on the field. Then\\nthe pacification by Krishna of the wrath of Gandhari distressed at the\\ndeath of her sons and grandsons. Then the cremation of the bodies of the\\ndeceased Rajas with due rites by that monarch (Yudhishthira) of great\\nwisdom and the foremost also of all virtuous men. Then upon the\\npresentation of water of the manes of the deceased princes having\\ncommenced, the story of Kunti\\'s acknowledgment of Karna as her son born\\nin secret. Those have all been described by the great Rishi Vyasa in the\\nhighly pathetic eleventh Parva. Its perusal moveth every feeling heart\\nwith sorrow and even draweth tears from the eyes. The number of sections\\ncomposed is twenty-seven. The number of slokas is seven hundred and\\nseventy-five.\\n\\n\"Twelfth in number cometh the Santi Parva, which increaseth the\\nunderstanding and in which is related the despondency of Yudhishthira on\\nhis having slain his fathers, brothers, sons, maternal uncles and\\nmatrimonial relations. In this Parva is described how from his bed of\\narrows Bhishma expounded various systems of duties worth the study of\\nkings desirous of knowledge; this Parva expounded the duties relative to\\nemergencies, with full indications of time and reasons. By understanding\\nthese, a person attaineth to consummate knowledge. The mysteries also of\\nfinal emancipation have been expatiated upon. This is the twelfth Parva\\nthe favourite of the wise. It consists of three hundred and thirty-nine\\nsections, and contains fourteen thousand, seven hundred and thirty-two\\nslokas.\\n\\n\"Next in order is the excellent Anusasana Parva. In it is described how\\nYudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, was reconciled to himself on hearing\\nthe exposition of duties by Bhishma, the son of Bhagirathi. This Parva\\ntreats of rules in detail and of Dharma and Artha; then the rules of\\ncharity and its merits; then the qualifications of donees, and the\\nsupreme ride-regarding gifts. This Parva also describes the ceremonials\\nof individual duty, the rules of conduct and the matchless merit of\\ntruth. This Parva showeth the great merit of Brahmanas and kine, and\\nunraveleth the mysteries of duties in relation to time and place. These\\nare embodied in the excellent Parva called Anusasana of varied incidents.\\nIn this hath been described the ascension of Bhishma to Heaven. This is\\nthe thirteenth Parva which hath laid down accurately the various duties\\nof men. The number of sections, in this is one hundred and forty-six. The\\nnumber of slokas is eight thousand.\\n\\n\"Then comes the fourteenth Parva Aswamedhika. In this is the excellent\\nstory of Samvarta and Marutta. Then is described the discovery (by the\\nPandavas) of golden treasuries; and then the birth of Parikshit who was\\nrevived by Krishna after having been burnt by the (celestial) weapon of\\nAswatthaman. The battles of Arjuna the son of Pandu, while following the\\nsacrificial horse let loose, with various princes who in wrath seized it.\\nThen is shown the great risk of Arjuna in his encounter with Vabhruvahana\\nthe son of Chitrangada (by Arjuna) the appointed daughter of the chief of\\nManipura. Then the story of the mongoose during the performance of the\\nhorse-sacrifice. This is the most wonderful Parva called Aswamedhika. The\\nnumber of sections is one hundred and three. The number of slokas\\ncomposed (in this) by Vyasa of true knowledge is three thousand, three\\nhundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"Then comes the fifteenth Parva called Asramvasika. In this,\\nDhritarashtra, abdicating the kingdom, and accompanied by Gandhari and\\nVidura went to the woods. Seeing this, the virtuous Pritha also, ever\\nengaged in cherishing her superiors, leaving the court of her sons,\\nfollowed the old couple. In this is described the wonderful meeting\\nthrough the kindness of Vyasa of the king (Dhritarashtra) with the\\nspirits of his slain children, grand-children, and other princes,\\nreturned from the other world. Then the monarch abandoning his sorrows\\nacquired with his wife the highest fruit of his meritorious actions. In\\nthis Parva, Vidura after having leaned on virtue all his life attaineth\\nto the most meritorious state.\\n\\n\"The learned son of Gavalgana, Sanjaya, also of passions under full\\ncontrol, and the foremost of ministers, attained, in the Parva, to the\\nblessed state. In this, Yudhishthira the just met Narada and heard from\\nhim about the extinction of the race of Vrishnis. This is the very\\nwonderful Parva called Asramvasika. The number of sections in this is\\nforty-two, and the number of slokas composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth\\nis one thousand five hundred and six.\\n\\n\"After this, you know, comes the Maushala of painful incidents. In this,\\nthose lion-hearted heroes (of the race of Vrishni) with the scars of many\\na field on their bodies, oppressed with the curse of a Brahmana, while\\ndeprived of reason from drink, impelled by the fates, slew each other on\\nthe shores of the Salt Sea with the Eraka grass which (in their hands)\\nbecame (invested with the fatal attributes of the) thunder. In this, both\\nBalarama and Kesava (Krishna) after causing the extermination of their\\nrace, their hour having come, themselves did not rise superior to the\\nsway of all-destroying Time. In this, Arjuna the foremost among men,\\ngoing to Dwaravati (Dwaraka) and seeing the city destitute of the\\nVrishnis was much affected and became exceedingly sorry. Then after the\\nfuneral of his maternal uncle Vasudeva the foremost among the Yadus\\n(Vrishnis), he saw the heroes of the Yadu race lying stretched in death\\non the spot where they had been drinking. He then caused the cremation of\\nthe bodies of the illustrious Krishna and Balarama and of the principal\\nmembers of the Vrishni race. Then as he was journeying from Dwaraka with\\nthe women and children, the old and the decrepit--the remnants of the\\nYadu race--he was met on the way by a heavy calamity. He witnessed also\\nthe disgrace of his bow Gandiva and the unpropitiousness of his celestial\\nweapons. Seeing all this, Arjuna became despondent and, pursuant to\\nVyasa\\'s advice, went to Yudhishthira and solicited permission to adopt\\nthe Sannyasa mode of life. This is the sixteenth Parva called Maushala\\nThe number of sections is eight and the number of slokas composed by\\nVyasa cognisant of truth is three hundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"The next is Mahaprasthanika, the seventeenth Parva.\\n\\n\"In this, those foremost among men the Pandavas abdicating their kingdom\\nwent with Draupadi on their great journey called Mahaprasthana. In this,\\nthey came across Agni, having arrived on the shore of the sea of red\\nwaters. In this, asked by Agni himself, Arjuna worshipped him duly,\\nreturned to him the excellent celestial bow called Gandiva. In this,\\nleaving his brothers who dropped one after another and Draupadi also,\\nYudhishthira went on his journey without once looking back on them. This\\nthe seventeenth Parva is called Mahaprasthanika. The number of sections\\nin this is three. The number of slokas also composed by Vyasa cognisant\\nof truth is three hundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"The Parva that comes after this, you must know, is the extraordinary one\\ncalled Svarga of celestial incidents. Then seeing the celestial car come\\nto take him, Yudhishthira moved by kindness towards the dog that\\naccompanied him, refused to ascend it without his companion. Observing\\nthe illustrious Yudhishthira\\'s steady adherence to virtue, Dharma (the\\ngod of justice) abandoning his canine form showed himself to the king.\\nThen Yudhishthira ascending to heaven felt much pain. The celestial\\nmessenger showed him hell by an act of deception. Then Yudhishthira, the\\nsoul of justice, heard the heart-rending lamentations of his brothers\\nabiding in that region under the discipline of Yama. Then Dharma and\\nIndra showed Yudhishthira the region appointed for sinners. Then\\nYudhishthira, after leaving the human body by a plunge in the celestial\\nGanges, attained to that region which his acts merited, and began to live\\nin joy respected by Indra and all other gods. This is the eighteenth\\nParva as narrated by the illustrious Vyasa. The number of slokas\\ncomposed, O ascetics, by the great Rishi in this is two hundred and nine.\\n\\n\"The above are the contents of the Eighteen Parvas. In the appendix\\n(Khita) are the Harivansa and the Vavishya. The number of slokas\\ncontained in the Harivansa is twelve thousand.\"\\n\\nThese are the contents of the section called Parva-sangraha. Sauti\\ncontinued, \"Eighteen Akshauhinis of troops came together for battle. The\\nencounter that ensued was terrible and lasted for eighteen days. He who\\nknows the four Vedas with all the Angas and Upanishads, but does not know\\nthis history (Bharata), cannot be regarded as wise. Vyasa of immeasurable\\nintelligence, has spoken of the Mahabharata as a treatise on Artha, on\\nDharma, and on Kama. Those who have listened to his history can never\\nbear to listen to others, as, indeed, they who have listened to the sweet\\nvoice of the male Kokila can never hear the dissonance of the crow\\'s\\ncawing. As the formation of the three worlds proceedeth from the five\\nelements, so do the inspirations of all poets proceed from this excellent\\ncomposition. O ye Brahman, as the four kinds of creatures (viviparous,\\noviparous, born of hot moisture and vegetables) are dependent on space\\nfor their existence, so the Puranas depend upon this history. As all the\\nsenses depend for their exercise upon the various modifications of the\\nmind, so do all acts (ceremonials) and moral qualities depend upon this\\ntreatise. There is not a story current in the world but doth depend on\\nthis history, even as body upon the food it taketh. All poets cherish the\\nBharata even as servants desirous of preferment always attend upon\\nmasters of good lineage. Even as the blessed domestic Asrama can never be\\nsurpassed by the three other Asramas (modes of life) so no poets can\\nsurpass this poem.\\n\\n\"Ye ascetics, shake off all inaction. Let your hearts be fixed on virtue,\\nfor virtue is the one only friend of him that has gone to the other\\nworld. Even the most intelligent by cherishing wealth and wives can never\\nmake these their own, nor are these possessions lasting. The Bharata\\nuttered by the lips of Dwaipayana is without a parallel; it is virtue\\nitself and sacred. It destroyeth sin and produceth good. He that\\nlisteneth to it while it is being recited hath no need of a bath in the\\nsacred waters of Pushkara. A Brahmana, whatever sins he may commit during\\nthe day through his senses, is freed from them all by reading the Bharata\\nin the evening. Whatever sins he may commit also in the night by deeds,\\nwords, or mind, he is freed from them all by reading Bharata in the first\\ntwilight (morning). He that giveth a hundred kine with horns mounted with\\ngold to a Brahmana well-posted up in the Vedas and all branches of\\nlearning, and he that daily listeneth to the sacred narrations of the\\nBharata, acquireth equal merit. As the wide ocean is easily passable by\\nmen having ships, so is this extensive history of great excellence and\\ndeep import with the help of this chapter called Parva sangraha.\"\\n\\nThus endeth the section called Parva-sangraha of the Adi Parva of the\\nblessed Mahabharata.\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "' II\\n\\n\"The Rishis said, \\'O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and\\ncircumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.\\'\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter\\nO ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as\\nSamanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas,\\nRama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by\\nimpatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And\\nwhen that fiery meteor, by his own valour, annihilated the entire tribe\\nof the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood. We\\nare told that his reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations\\nof blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the\\nsanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom\\nRichika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, \\'O Rama, O\\nblessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the\\nreverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour, O mighty\\none! Blessings be upon thee. O thou illustrious one, ask the boon that\\nthou mayst desire.\\'\\n\\n\"Rama said, \\'If, O fathers, ye are favourably disposed towards me, the\\nboon I ask is that I may be absolved from the sins born of my having\\nannihilated the Kshatriyas in anger, and that the lakes I have formed may\\nbecome famous in the world as holy shrines.\\' The Pitris then said, \\'So\\nshall it be. But be thou pacified.\\' And Rama was pacified accordingly.\\nThe region that lieth near unto those lakes of gory water, from that time\\nhath been celebrated as Samanta-panchaka the holy. The wise have declared\\nthat every country should be distinguished by a name significant of some\\ncircumstance which may have rendered it famous. In the interval between\\nthe Dwapara and the Kali Yugas there happened at Samanta-panchaka the\\nencounter between the armies of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. In that\\nholy region, without ruggedness of any kind, were assembled eighteen\\nAkshauhinis of soldiers eager for battle. And, O Brahmanas, having come\\nthereto, they were all slain on the spot. Thus the name of that region, O\\nBrahmanas, hath been explained, and the country described to you as a\\nsacred and delightful one. I have mentioned the whole of what relateth to\\nit as the region is celebrated throughout the three worlds.\\'\\n\\n\"The Rishis said, \\'We have a desire to know, O son of Suta, what is\\nimplied by the term Akshauhini that hath been used by thee. Tell us in\\nfull what is the number of horse and foot, chariots and elephants, which\\ncompose an Akshauhini for thou art fully informed.\\'\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'One chariot, one elephant, five foot-soldiers, and three\\nhorses form one Patti; three pattis make one Sena-mukha; three\\nsena-mukhas are called a Gulma; three gulmas, a Gana; three ganas, a\\nVahini; three vahinis together are called a Pritana; three pritanas form\\na Chamu; three chamus, one Anikini; and an anikini taken ten times forms,\\nas it is styled by those who know, an Akshauhini. O ye best of Brahmanas,\\narithmeticians have calculated that the number of chariots in an\\nAkshauhini is twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy. The measure\\nof elephants must be fixed at the same number. O ye pure, you must know\\nthat the number of foot-soldiers is one hundred and nine thousand, three\\nhundred and fifty, the number of horse is sixty-five thousand, six\\nhundred and ten. These, O Brahmanas, as fully explained by me, are the\\nnumbers of an Akshauhini as said by those acquainted with the principles\\nof numbers. O best of Brahmanas, according to this calculation were\\ncomposed the eighteen Akshauhinis of the Kaurava and the Pandava army.\\nTime, whose acts are wonderful assembled them on that spot and having\\nmade the Kauravas the cause, destroyed them all. Bhishma acquainted with\\nchoice of weapons, fought for ten days. Drona protected the Kaurava\\nVahinis for five days. Kama the desolator of hostile armies fought for\\ntwo days; and Salya for half a day. After that lasted for half a day the\\nencounter with clubs between Duryodhana and Bhima. At the close of that\\nday, Aswatthaman and Kripa destroyed the army of Yudishthira in the night\\nwhile sleeping without suspicion of danger.\\n\\n\\'O Saunaka, this best of narrations called Bharata which has begun to be\\nrepeated at thy sacrifice, was formerly repeated at the sacrifice of\\nJanamejaya by an intelligent disciple of Vyasa. It is divided into\\nseveral sections; in the beginning are Paushya, Pauloma, and Astika\\nparvas, describing in full the valour and renown of kings. It is a work\\nwhose description, diction, and sense are varied and wonderful. It\\ncontains an account of various manners and rites. It is accepted by the\\nwise, as the state called Vairagya is by men desirous of final release.\\nAs Self among things to be known, as life among things that are dear, so\\nis this history that furnisheth the means of arriving at the knowledge of\\nBrahma the first among all the sastras. There is not a story current in\\nthis world but doth depend upon this history even as the body upon the\\nfoot that it taketh. As masters of good lineage are ever attended upon by\\nservants desirous of preferment so is the Bharata cherished by all poets.\\nAs the words constituting the several branches of knowledge appertaining\\nto the world and the Veda display only vowels and consonants, so this\\nexcellent history displayeth only the highest wisdom.\\n\\n\\'Listen, O ye ascetics, to the outlines of the several divisions (parvas)\\nof this history called Bharata, endued with great wisdom, of sections and\\nfeet that are wonderful and various, of subtile meanings and logical\\nconnections, and embellished with the substance of the Vedas.\\n\\n\\'The first parva is called Anukramanika; the second, Sangraha; then\\nPaushya; then Pauloma; the Astika; then Adivansavatarana.

O ye ascetics,\\nthe great Vyasa hath composed one hundred and eighty-six sections in this\\nParva. The number of slokas also composed in this by the great Rishi is\\nsix thousand, six hundred and ninety-eight.\\n\\n\"Then is recited the Bhishma Parva replete with wonderful incidents. In\\nthis hath been narrated by Sanjaya the formation of the region known as\\nJambu. Here hath been described the great depression of Yudhishthira\\'s\\narmy, and also a fierce fight for ten successive days. In this the\\nhigh-souled Vasudeva by reasons based on the philosophy of final release\\ndrove away Arjuna\\'s compunction springing from the latter\\'s regard for\\nhis kindred (whom he was on the eve of slaying). In this the magnanimous\\nKrishna, attentive to the welfare of Yudhishthira, seeing the loss\\ninflicted (on the Pandava army), descended swiftly from his chariot\\nhimself and ran, with dauntless breast, his driving whip in hand, to\\neffect the death of Bhishma. In this, Krishna also smote with piercing\\nwords Arjuna, the bearer of the Gandiva and the foremost in battle among\\nall wielders of weapons. In this, the foremost of bowmen, Arjuna, placing\\nShikandin before him and piercing Bhishma with his sharpest arrows felled\\nhim from his chariot. In this, Bhishma lay stretched on his bed of\\narrows. This extensive Parva is known as the sixth in the Bharata. In\\nthis have been composed one hundred and seventeen sections. The number of\\nslokas is five thousand, eight hundred and eighty-four as told by Vyasa\\nconversant with the Vedas.\\n\\n\"Then is recited the wonderful Parva called Drona full of incidents.\\nFirst comes the installation in the command of the army of the great\\ninstructor in arms, Drona: then the vow made by that great master of\\nweapons of seizing the wise Yudhishthira in battle to please Duryodhana;\\nthen the retreat of Arjuna from the field before the Sansaptakas, then\\nthe overthrow of Bhagadatta like to a second Indra in the field, with the\\nelephant Supritika, by Arjuna; then the death of the hero Abhimanyu in\\nhis teens, alone and unsupported, at the hands of many Maharathas\\nincluding Jayadratha; then after the death of Abhimanyu, the destruction\\nby Arjuna, in battle of seven Akshauhinis of troops and then of\\nJayadratha; then the entry, by Bhima of mighty arms and by that foremost\\nof warriors-in-chariot, Satyaki, into the Kaurava ranks impenetrable even\\nto the gods, in search of Arjuna in obedience to the orders of\\nYudhishthira, and the destruction of the remnant of the Sansaptakas. In\\nthe Drona Parva, is the death of Alambusha, of Srutayus, of Jalasandha,\\nof Shomadatta, of Virata, of the great warrior-in-chariot Drupada, of\\nGhatotkacha and others; in this Parva, Aswatthaman, excited beyond\\nmeasure at the fall of his father in battle, discharged the terrible\\nweapon Narayana. Then the glory of Rudra in connection with the burning\\n(of the three cities). Then the arrival of Vyasa and recital by him of\\nthe glory of Krishna and Arjuna. This is the great seventh Parva of the\\nBharata in which all the heroic chiefs and princes mentioned were sent to\\ntheir account. The number of sections in this is one hundred and seventy.\\nThe number of slokas as composed in the Drona Parva by Rishi Vyasa, the\\nson of Parasara and the possessor of true knowledge after much\\nmeditation, is eight thousand, nine hundred and nine.\\n\\n\"Then comes the most wonderful Parva called Karna. In this is narrated\\nthe appointment of the wise king of Madra as (Karna\\'s) charioteer. Then\\nthe history of the fall of the Asura Tripura. Then the application to\\neach other by Karna and Salya of harsh words on their setting out for the\\nfield, then the story of the swan and the crow recited in insulting\\nallusion: then the death of Pandya at the hands of the high-souled\\nAswatthaman; then the death of Dandasena; then that of Darda; then\\nYudhishthira\\'s imminent risk in single combat with Karna in the presence\\nof all the warriors; then the mutual wrath of Yudhishthira and Arjuna;\\nthen Krishna\\'s pacification of Arjuna. In this Parva, Bhima, in\\nfulfilment of his vow, having ripped open Dussasana\\'s breast in battle\\ndrank the blood of his heart. Then Arjuna slew the great Karna in single\\ncombat. Readers of the Bharata call this the eighth Parva. The number of\\nsections in this is sixty-nine and the number of slokas is four thousand,\\nnine hundred and sixty-tour.\\n\\n\"Then hath been recited the wonderful Parva called Salya. After all the\\ngreat warriors had been slain, the king of Madra became the leader of the\\n(Kaurava) army. The encounters one after another, of charioteers, have\\nbeen here described. Then comes the fall of the great Salya at the hands\\nof Yudhishthira, the Just. Here also is the death of Sakuni in battle at\\nthe hands of Sahadeva. Upon only a small remnant of the troops remaining\\nalive after the immense slaughter, Duryodhana went to the lake and\\ncreating for himself room within its waters lay stretched there for some\\ntime. Then is narrated the receipt of this intelligence by Bhima from the\\nfowlers: then is narrated how, moved by the insulting speeches of the\\nintelligent Yudhishthira, Duryodhana ever unable to bear affronts, came\\nout of the waters. Then comes the encounter with clubs, between\\nDuryodhana and Bhima; then the arrival, at the time of such encounter, of\\nBalarama: then is described the sacredness of the Saraswati; then the\\nprogress of the encounter with clubs; then the fracture of Duryodhana\\'s\\nthighs in battle by Bhima with (a terrific hurl of) his mace. These all\\nhave been described in the wonderful ninth Parva. In this the number of\\nsections is fifty-nine and the number of slokas composed by the great\\nVyasa--the spreader of the fame of the Kauravas--is three thousand, two\\nhundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"Then shall I describe the Parva called Sauptika of frightful incidents.\\nOn the Pandavas having gone away, the mighty charioteers, Kritavarman,\\nKripa, and the son of Drona, came to the field of battle in the evening\\nand there saw king Duryodhana lying on the ground, his thighs broken, and\\nhimself covered with blood. Then the great charioteer, the son of Drona,\\nof terrible wrath, vowed, \\'without killing all the Panchalas including\\nDrishtadyumna, and the Pandavas also with all their allies, I will not\\ntake off armour.\\' Having spoken those words, the three warriors leaving\\nDuryodhana\\'s side entered the great forest just as the sun was setting.\\nWhile sitting under a large banian tree in the night, they saw an owl\\nkilling numerous crows one after another. At the sight of this,\\nAswatthaman, his heart full of rage at the thought of his father\\'s fate,\\nresolved to slay the slumbering Panchalas. And wending to the gate of the\\ncamp, he saw there a Rakshasa of frightful visage, his head reaching to\\nthe very heavens, guarding the entrance. And seeing that Rakshasa\\nobstructing all his weapons, the son of Drona speedily pacified by\\nworship the three-eyed Rudra. And then accompanied by Kritavarman and\\nKripa he slew all the sons of Draupadi, all the Panchalas with\\nDhrishtadyumna and others, together with their relatives, slumbering\\nunsuspectingly in the night. All perished on that fatal night except the\\nfive Pandavas and the great warrior Satyaki. Those escaped owing to\\nKrishna\\'s counsels, then the charioteer of Dhrishtadyumna brought to the\\nPandavas intelligence of the slaughter of the slumbering Panchalas by the\\nson of Drona. Then Draupadi distressed at the death of her sons and\\nbrothers and father sat before her lords resolved to kill herself by\\nfasting. Then Bhima of terrible prowess, moved by the words of Draupadi,\\nresolved, to please her; and speedily taking up his mace followed in\\nwrath the son of his preceptor in arms. The son of Drona from fear of\\nBhimasena and impelled by the fates and moved also by anger discharged a\\ncelestial weapon saying, \\'This is for the destruction of all the\\nPandavas\\'; then Krishna saying. \\'This shall not be\\', neutralised\\nAswatthaman\\'s speech. Then Arjuna neutralised that weapon by one of his\\nown. Seeing the wicked Aswatthaman\\'s destructive intentions, Dwaipayana\\nand Krishna pronounced curses on him which the latter returned. Pandava\\nthen deprived the mighty warrior-in-chariot Aswatthaman, of the jewel on\\nhis head, and became exceedingly glad, and, boastful of their success,\\nmade a present of it to the sorrowing Draupadi. Thus the tenth Parva,\\ncalled Sauptika, is recited. The great Vyasa hath composed this in\\neighteen sections. The number of slokas also composed (in this) by the\\ngreat reciter of sacred truths is eight hundred and seventy. In this\\nParva has been put together by the great Rishi the two Parvas called\\nSauptika and Aishika.\\n\\n\"After this hath been recited the highly pathetic Parva called Stri,\\nDhritarashtra of prophetic eye, afflicted at the death of his children,\\nand moved by enmity towards Bhima, broke into pieces a statue of hard\\niron deftly placed before him by Krishna (as substitute of Bhima). Then\\nVidura, removing the distressed Dhritarashtra\\'s affection for worldly\\nthings by reasons pointing to final release, consoled that wise monarch.\\nThen hath been described the wending of the distressed Dhritarashtra\\naccompanied by the ladies of his house to the field of battle of the\\nKauravas. Here follow the pathetic wailings of the wives of the slain\\nheroes. Then the wrath of Gandhari and Dhritarashtra and their loss of\\nconsciousness. Then the Kshatriya ladies saw those heroes,--their\\nunreturning sons, brothers, and fathers,--lying dead on the field. Then\\nthe pacification by Krishna of the wrath of Gandhari distressed at the\\ndeath of her sons and grandsons. Then the cremation of the bodies of the\\ndeceased Rajas with due rites by that monarch (Yudhishthira) of great\\nwisdom and the foremost also of all virtuous men. Then upon the\\npresentation of water of the manes of the deceased princes having\\ncommenced, the story of Kunti\\'s acknowledgment of Karna as her son born\\nin secret. Those have all been described by the great Rishi Vyasa in the\\nhighly pathetic eleventh Parva. Its perusal moveth every feeling heart\\nwith sorrow and even draweth tears from the eyes. The number of sections\\ncomposed is twenty-seven. The number of slokas is seven hundred and\\nseventy-five.\\n\\n\"Twelfth in number cometh the Santi Parva, which increaseth the\\nunderstanding and in which is related the despondency of Yudhishthira on\\nhis having slain his fathers, brothers, sons, maternal uncles and\\nmatrimonial relations. In this Parva is described how from his bed of\\narrows Bhishma expounded various systems of duties worth the study of\\nkings desirous of knowledge; this Parva expounded the duties relative to\\nemergencies, with full indications of time and reasons. By understanding\\nthese, a person attaineth to consummate knowledge. The mysteries also of\\nfinal emancipation have been expatiated upon. This is the twelfth Parva\\nthe favourite of the wise. It consists of three hundred and thirty-nine\\nsections, and contains fourteen thousand, seven hundred and thirty-two\\nslokas.\\n\\n\"Next in order is the excellent Anusasana Parva. In it is described how\\nYudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, was reconciled to himself on hearing\\nthe exposition of duties by Bhishma, the son of Bhagirathi. This Parva\\ntreats of rules in detail and of Dharma and Artha; then the rules of\\ncharity and its merits; then the qualifications of donees, and the\\nsupreme ride-regarding gifts. This Parva also describes the ceremonials\\nof individual duty, the rules of conduct and the matchless merit of\\ntruth. This Parva showeth the great merit of Brahmanas and kine, and\\nunraveleth the mysteries of duties in relation to time and place. These\\nare embodied in the excellent Parva called Anusasana of varied incidents.\\nIn this hath been described the ascension of Bhishma to Heaven. This is\\nthe thirteenth Parva which hath laid down accurately the various duties\\nof men. The number of sections, in this is one hundred and forty-six. The\\nnumber of slokas is eight thousand.\\n\\n\"Then comes the fourteenth Parva Aswamedhika. In this is the excellent\\nstory of Samvarta and Marutta. Then is described the discovery (by the\\nPandavas) of golden treasuries; and then the birth of Parikshit who was\\nrevived by Krishna after having been burnt by the (celestial) weapon of\\nAswatthaman. The battles of Arjuna the son of Pandu, while following the\\nsacrificial horse let loose, with various princes who in wrath seized it.\\nThen is shown the great risk of Arjuna in his encounter with Vabhruvahana\\nthe son of Chitrangada (by Arjuna) the appointed daughter of the chief of\\nManipura. Then the story of the mongoose during the performance of the\\nhorse-sacrifice. This is the most wonderful Parva called Aswamedhika. The\\nnumber of sections is one hundred and three. The number of slokas\\ncomposed (in this) by Vyasa of true knowledge is three thousand, three\\nhundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"Then comes the fifteenth Parva called Asramvasika. In this,\\nDhritarashtra, abdicating the kingdom, and accompanied by Gandhari and\\nVidura went to the woods. Seeing this, the virtuous Pritha also, ever\\nengaged in cherishing her superiors, leaving the court of her sons,\\nfollowed the old couple. In this is described the wonderful meeting\\nthrough the kindness of Vyasa of the king (Dhritarashtra) with the\\nspirits of his slain children, grand-children, and other princes,\\nreturned from the other world. Then the monarch abandoning his sorrows\\nacquired with his wife the highest fruit of his meritorious actions. In\\nthis Parva, Vidura after having leaned on virtue all his life attaineth\\nto the most meritorious state.\\n\\n\"The learned son of Gavalgana, Sanjaya, also of passions under full\\ncontrol, and the foremost of ministers, attained, in the Parva, to the\\nblessed state. In this, Yudhishthira the just met Narada and heard from\\nhim about the extinction of the race of Vrishnis. This is the very\\nwonderful Parva called Asramvasika. The number of sections in this is\\nforty-two, and the number of slokas composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth\\nis one thousand five hundred and six.\\n\\n\"After this, you know, comes the Maushala of painful incidents. In this,\\nthose lion-hearted heroes (of the race of Vrishni) with the scars of many\\na field on their bodies, oppressed with the curse of a Brahmana, while\\ndeprived of reason from drink, impelled by the fates, slew each other on\\nthe shores of the Salt Sea with the Eraka grass which (in their hands)\\nbecame (invested with the fatal attributes of the) thunder. In this, both\\nBalarama and Kesava (Krishna) after causing the extermination of their\\nrace, their hour having come, themselves did not rise superior to the\\nsway of all-destroying Time. In this, Arjuna the foremost among men,\\ngoing to Dwaravati (Dwaraka) and seeing the city destitute of the\\nVrishnis was much affected and became exceedingly sorry. Then after the\\nfuneral of his maternal uncle Vasudeva the foremost among the Yadus\\n(Vrishnis), he saw the heroes of the Yadu race lying stretched in death\\non the spot where they had been drinking. He then caused the cremation of\\nthe bodies of the illustrious Krishna and Balarama and of the principal\\nmembers of the Vrishni race. Then as he was journeying from Dwaraka with\\nthe women and children, the old and the decrepit--the remnants of the\\nYadu race--he was met on the way by a heavy calamity. He witnessed also\\nthe disgrace of his bow Gandiva and the unpropitiousness of his celestial\\nweapons. Seeing all this, Arjuna became despondent and, pursuant to\\nVyasa\\'s advice, went to Yudhishthira and solicited permission to adopt\\nthe Sannyasa mode of life. This is the sixteenth Parva called Maushala\\nThe number of sections is eight and the number of slokas composed by\\nVyasa cognisant of truth is three hundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"The next is Mahaprasthanika, the seventeenth Parva.\\n\\n\"In this, those foremost among men the Pandavas abdicating their kingdom\\nwent with Draupadi on their great journey called Mahaprasthana. In this,\\nthey came across Agni, having arrived on the shore of the sea of red\\nwaters. In this, asked by Agni himself, Arjuna worshipped him duly,\\nreturned to him the excellent celestial bow called Gandiva. In this,\\nleaving his brothers who dropped one after another and Draupadi also,\\nYudhishthira went on his journey without once looking back on them. This\\nthe seventeenth Parva is called Mahaprasthanika. The number of sections\\nin this is three. The number of slokas also composed by Vyasa cognisant\\nof truth is three hundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"The Parva that comes after this, you must know, is the extraordinary one\\ncalled Svarga of celestial incidents. Then seeing the celestial car come\\nto take him, Yudhishthira moved by kindness towards the dog that\\naccompanied him, refused to ascend it without his companion. Observing\\nthe illustrious Yudhishthira\\'s steady adherence to virtue, Dharma (the\\ngod of justice) abandoning his canine form showed himself to the king.\\nThen Yudhishthira ascending to heaven felt much pain. The celestial\\nmessenger showed him hell by an act of deception. Then Yudhishthira, the\\nsoul of justice, heard the heart-rending lamentations of his brothers\\nabiding in that region under the discipline of Yama. Then Dharma and\\nIndra showed Yudhishthira the region appointed for sinners. Then\\nYudhishthira, after leaving the human body by a plunge in the celestial\\nGanges, attained to that region which his acts merited, and began to live\\nin joy respected by Indra and all other gods. This is the eighteenth\\nParva as narrated by the illustrious Vyasa. The number of slokas\\ncomposed, O ascetics, by the great Rishi in this is two hundred and nine.\\n\\n\"The above are the contents of the Eighteen Parvas. In the appendix\\n(Khita) are the Harivansa and the Vavishya. The number of slokas\\ncontained in the Harivansa is twelve thousand.\"\\n\\nThese are the contents of the section called Parva-sangraha. Sauti\\ncontinued, \"Eighteen Akshauhinis of troops came together for battle. The\\nencounter that ensued was terrible and lasted for eighteen days. He who\\nknows the four Vedas with all the Angas and Upanishads, but does not know\\nthis history (Bharata), cannot be regarded as wise. Vyasa of immeasurable\\nintelligence, has spoken of the Mahabharata as a treatise on Artha, on\\nDharma, and on Kama. Those who have listened to his history can never\\nbear to listen to others, as, indeed, they who have listened to the sweet\\nvoice of the male Kokila can never hear the dissonance of the crow\\'s\\ncawing. As the formation of the three worlds proceedeth from the five\\nelements, so do the inspirations of all poets proceed from this excellent\\ncomposition. O ye Brahman, as the four kinds of creatures (viviparous,\\noviparous, born of hot moisture and vegetables) are dependent on space\\nfor their existence, so the Puranas depend upon this history. As all the\\nsenses depend for their exercise upon the various modifications of the\\nmind, so do all acts (ceremonials) and moral qualities depend upon this\\ntreatise. There is not a story current in the world but doth depend on\\nthis history, even as body upon the food it taketh. All poets cherish the\\nBharata even as servants desirous of preferment always attend upon\\nmasters of good lineage. Even as the blessed domestic Asrama can never be\\nsurpassed by the three other Asramas (modes of life) so no poets can\\nsurpass this poem.\\n\\n\"Ye ascetics, shake off all inaction. Let your hearts be fixed on virtue,\\nfor virtue is the one only friend of him that has gone to the other\\nworld. Even the most intelligent by cherishing wealth and wives can never\\nmake these their own, nor are these possessions lasting. The Bharata\\nuttered by the lips of Dwaipayana is without a parallel; it is virtue\\nitself and sacred. It destroyeth sin and produceth good. He that\\nlisteneth to it while it is being recited hath no need of a bath in the\\nsacred waters of Pushkara. A Brahmana, whatever sins he may commit during\\nthe day through his senses, is freed from them all by reading the Bharata\\nin the evening. Whatever sins he may commit also in the night by deeds,\\nwords, or mind, he is freed from them all by reading Bharata in the first\\ntwilight (morning). He that giveth a hundred kine with horns mounted with\\ngold to a Brahmana well-posted up in the Vedas and all branches of\\nlearning, and he that daily listeneth to the sacred narrations of the\\nBharata, acquireth equal merit. As the wide ocean is easily passable by\\nmen having ships, so is this extensive history of great excellence and\\ndeep import with the help of this chapter called Parva sangraha.\"\\n\\nThus endeth the section called Parva-sangraha of the Adi Parva of the\\nblessed Mahabharata.\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "' II  \"The Rishis said, \\'O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and circumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.\\'  \"Sauti said, \\'Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter O ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as Samanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas, Rama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by impatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And when that fiery meteor, by his own valour, annihilated the entire tribe of the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood. We are told that his reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations of blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the sanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom Richika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, \\'O Rama, O blessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the reverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour, O mighty one! Blessings be upon thee. O thou illustrious one, ask the boon that thou mayst desire.\\'  \"Rama said, \\'If, O fathers, ye are favourably disposed towards me, the boon I ask is that I may be absolved from the sins born of my having annihilated the Kshatriyas in anger, and that the lakes I have formed may become famous in the world as holy shrines.\\' The Pitris then said, \\'So shall it be. But be thou pacified.\\' And Rama was pacified accordingly. The region that lieth near unto those lakes of gory water, from that time hath been celebrated as Samanta-panchaka the holy. The wise have declared that every country should be distinguished by a name significant of some circumstance which may have rendered it famous. In the interval between the Dwapara and the Kali Yugas there happened at Samanta-panchaka the encounter between the armies of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. In that holy region, without ruggedness of any kind, were assembled eighteen Akshauhinis of soldiers eager for battle. And, O Brahmanas, having come thereto, they were all slain on the spot. Thus the name of that region, O Brahmanas, hath been explained, and the country described to you as a sacred and delightful one. I have mentioned the whole of what relateth to it as the region is celebrated throughout the three worlds.\\'  \"The Rishis said, \\'We have a desire to know, O son of Suta, what is implied by the term Akshauhini that hath been used by thee. Tell us in full what is the number of horse and foot, chariots and elephants, which compose an Akshauhini for thou art fully informed.\\'  \"Sauti said, \\'One chariot, one elephant, five foot-soldiers, and three horses form one Patti; three pattis make one Sena-mukha; three sena-mukhas are called a Gulma; three gulmas, a Gana; three ganas, a Vahini; three vahinis together are called a Pritana; three pritanas form a Chamu; three chamus, one Anikini; and an anikini taken ten times forms, as it is styled by those who know, an Akshauhini. O ye best of Brahmanas, arithmeticians have calculated that the number of chariots in an Akshauhini is twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy. The measure of elephants must be fixed at the same number. O ye pure, you must know that the number of foot-soldiers is one hundred and nine thousand, three hundred and fifty, the number of horse is sixty-five thousand, six hundred and ten. These, O Brahmanas, as fully explained by me, are the numbers of an Akshauhini as said by those acquainted with the principles of numbers. O best of Brahmanas, according to this calculation were composed the eighteen Akshauhinis of the Kaurava and the Pandava army. Time, whose acts are wonderful assembled them on that spot and having made the Kauravas the cause, destroyed them all. Bhishma acquainted with choice of weapons, fought for ten days. Drona protected the Kaurava Vahinis for five days. Kama the desolator of hostile armies fought for two days; and Salya for half a day. After that lasted for half a day the encounter with clubs between Duryodhana and Bhima. At the close of that day, Aswatthaman and Kripa destroyed the army of Yudishthira in the night while sleeping without suspicion of danger.  \\'O Saunaka, this best of narrations called Bharata which has begun to be repeated at thy sacrifice, was formerly repeated at the sacrifice of Janamejaya by an intelligent disciple of Vyasa. It is divided into several sections; in the beginning are Paushya, Pauloma, and Astika parvas, describing in full the valour and renown of kings. It is a work whose description, diction, and sense are varied and wonderful. It contains an account of various manners and rites. It is accepted by the wise, as the state called Vairagya is by men desirous of final release. As Self among things to be known, as life among things that are dear, so is this history that furnisheth the means of arriving at the knowledge of Brahma the first among all the sastras. There is not a story current in this world but doth depend upon this history even as the body upon the foot that it taketh. As masters of good lineage are ever attended upon by servants desirous of preferment so is the Bharata cherished by all poets. As the words constituting the several branches of knowledge appertaining to the world and the Veda display only vowels and consonants, so this excellent history displayeth only the highest wisdom.  \\'Listen, O ye ascetics, to the outlines of the several divisions (parvas) of this history called Bharata, endued with great wisdom, of sections and feet that are wonderful and various, of subtile meanings and logical connections, and embellished with the substance of the Vedas.  \\'The first parva is called Anukramanika; the second, Sangraha; then Paushya; then Pauloma; the Astika; then Adivansavatarana. Then comes the Sambhava of wonderful and thrilling incidents. Then comes Jatugrihadaha (setting fire to the house of lac) and then Hidimbabadha (the killing of Hidimba) parvas; then comes Baka-badha (slaughter of Baka) and then Chitraratha. The next is called Swayamvara (selection of husband by Panchali), in which Arjuna by the exercise of Kshatriya virtues, won Draupadi for wife. Then comes Vaivahika (marriage). Then comes Viduragamana (advent of Vidura), Rajyalabha (acquirement of kingdom), Arjuna-banavasa (exile of Arjuna) and Subhadra-harana (the carrying away of Subhadra). After these come Harana-harika, Khandava-daha (the burning of the Khandava forest) and Maya-darsana (meeting with Maya the Asura architect). Then come Sabha, Mantra, Jarasandha, Digvijaya (general campaign). After Digvijaya come Raja-suyaka, Arghyaviharana (the robbing of the Arghya) and Sisupala-badha (the killing of Sisupala). After these, Dyuta (gambling), Anudyuta (subsequent to gambling), Aranyaka, and Krimira-badha (destruction of Krimira). The Arjuna-vigamana (the travels of Arjuna), Kairati.

The number of slokas is eleven thousand, six hundred and sixty-four.  \"The extensive Parva that comes next is called Virata.

The number of slokas is two thousand and fifty.  \"Listen then to (the contents of) the fifth Parva which must be known as Udyoga. While the Pandavas, desirous of victory, were residing in the place called Upaplavya, Duryodhana and Arjuna both went at the same time to Vasudeva, and said, \"You should render us assistance in this war.\" The high-souled Krishna, upon these words being uttered, replied, \"O ye first of men, a counsellor in myself who will not fight and one Akshauhini of troops, which of these shall I give to which of you?\" Blind to his own interests, the foolish Duryodhana asked for the troops; while Arjuna solicited Krishna as an unfighting counsellor. Then is described how, when the king of Madra was coming for the assistance of the Pandavas, Duryodhana, having deceived him on the way by presents and hospitality, induced him to grant a boon and then solicited his assistance in battle; how Salya, having passed his word to Duryodhana, went to the Pandavas and consoled them by reciting the history of Indra\\'s victory (over Vritra). Then comes the despatch by the Pandavas of their Purohita (priest) to the Kauravas. Then is described how king Dhritarashtra of great prowess, having heard the word of the purohita of the Pandavas and the story of Indra\\'s victory decided upon sending his purohita and ultimately despatched Sanjaya as envoy to the Pandavas from desire for peace. Here hath been described the sleeplessness of Dhritarashtra from anxiety upon hearing all about the Pandavas and their friends, Vasudeva and others. It was on this occasion that Vidura addressed to the wise king Dhritarashtra various counsels that were full of wisdom. It was here also that Sanat-sujata recited to the anxious and sorrowing monarch the excellent truths of spiritual philosophy. On the next morning Sanjaya spoke, in the court of the King, of the identity of Vasudeva and Arjuna. It was then that the illustrious Krishna, moved by kindness and a desire for peace, went himself to the Kaurava capital, Hastinapura, for bringing about peace. Then comes the rejection by prince Duryodhana of the embassy of Krishna who had come to solicit peace for the benefit of both parties.

Then the exhibition by Krishna, before the assembled Rajas, of his Yoga powers upon learning the evil counsels of Duryodhana and Karna; then Krishna\\'s taking Karna in his chariot and his tendering to him of advice, and Karna\\'s rejection of the same from pride. Then the return of Krishna, the chastiser of enemies from Hastinapura to Upaplavya, and his narration to the Pandavas of all that had happened. It was then that those oppressors of foes, the Pandavas, having heard all and consulted properly with each other, made every preparation for war. Then comes the march from Hastinapura, for battle, of foot-soldiers, horses, charioteers and elephants. Then the tale of the troops by both parties. Then the despatch by prince Duryodhana of Uluka as envoy to the Pandavas on the day previous to the battle. Then the tale of charioteers of different classes. Then the story of Amba.

O ye ascetics, the great Vyasa hath composed one hundred and eighty-six sections in this Parva. The number of slokas also composed in this by the great Rishi is six thousand, six hundred and ninety-eight.  \"Then is recited the Bhishma Parva replete with wonderful incidents. In this hath been narrated by Sanjaya the formation of the region known as Jambu. Here hath been described the great depression of Yudhishthira\\'s army, and also a fierce fight for ten successive days. In this the high-souled Vasudeva by reasons based on the philosophy of final release drove away Arjuna\\'s compunction springing from the latter\\'s regard for his kindred (whom he was on the eve of slaying). In this the magnanimous Krishna, attentive to the welfare of Yudhishthira, seeing the loss inflicted (on the Pandava army), descended swiftly from his chariot himself and ran, with dauntless breast, his driving whip in hand, to effect the death of Bhishma. In this, Krishna also smote with piercing words Arjuna, the bearer of the Gandiva and the foremost in battle among all wielders of weapons. In this, the foremost of bowmen, Arjuna, placing Shikandin before him and piercing Bhishma with his sharpest arrows felled him from his chariot. In this, Bhishma lay stretched on his bed of arrows. This extensive Parva is known as the sixth in the Bharata. In this have been composed one hundred and seventeen sections. The number of slokas is five thousand, eight hundred and eighty-four as told by Vyasa conversant with the Vedas.  \"Then is recited the wonderful Parva called Drona full of incidents.

In the Drona Parva, is the death of Alambusha, of Srutayus, of Jalasandha, of Shomadatta, of Virata, of the great warrior-in-chariot Drupada, of Ghatotkacha and others; in this Parva, Aswatthaman, excited beyond measure at the fall of his father in battle, discharged the terrible weapon Narayana. Then the glory of Rudra in connection with the burning (of the three cities). Then the arrival of Vyasa and recital by him of the glory of Krishna and Arjuna. This is the great seventh Parva of the Bharata in which all the heroic chiefs and princes mentioned were sent to their account. The number of sections in this is one hundred and seventy. The number of slokas as composed in the Drona Parva by Rishi Vyasa, the son of Parasara and the possessor of true knowledge after much meditation, is eight thousand, nine hundred and nine.  \"Then comes the most wonderful Parva called Karna. In this is narrated the appointment of the wise king of Madra as (Karna\\'s) charioteer. Then the history of the fall of the Asura Tripura.

In this Parva, Bhima, in fulfilment of his vow, having ripped open Dussasana\\'s breast in battle drank the blood of his heart. Then Arjuna slew the great Karna in single combat. Readers of the Bharata call this the eighth Parva. The number of sections in this is sixty-nine and the number of slokas is four thousand, nine hundred and sixty-tour.  \"Then hath been recited the wonderful Parva called Salya. After all the great warriors had been slain, the king of Madra became the leader of the (Kaurava) army. The encounters one after another, of charioteers, have been here described. Then comes the fall of the great Salya at the hands of Yudhishthira, the Just. Here also is the death of Sakuni in battle at the hands of Sahadeva. Upon only a small remnant of the troops remaining alive after the immense slaughter, Duryodhana went to the lake and creating for himself room within its waters lay stretched there for some time. Then is narrated the receipt of this intelligence by Bhima from the fowlers: then is narrated how, moved by the insulting speeches of the intelligent Yudhishthira, Duryodhana ever unable to bear affronts, came out of the waters. Then comes the encounter with clubs, between Duryodhana and Bhima; then the arrival, at the time of such encounter, of Balarama: then is described the sacredness of the Saraswati; then the progress of the encounter with clubs; then the fracture of Duryodhana\\'s thighs in battle by Bhima with (a terrific hurl of) his mace. These all have been described in the wonderful ninth Parva. In this the number of sections is fifty-nine and the number of slokas composed by the great Vyasa--the spreader of the fame of the Kauravas--is three thousand, two hundred and twenty.  \"Then shall I describe the Parva called Sauptika of frightful incidents. On the Pandavas having gone away, the mighty charioteers, Kritavarman, Kripa, and the son of Drona, came to the field of battle in the evening and there saw king Duryodhana lying on the ground, his thighs broken, and himself covered with blood. Then the great charioteer, the son of Drona, of terrible wrath, vowed, \\'without killing all the Panchalas including Drishtadyumna, and the Pandavas also with all their allies, I will not take off armour.\\' Having spoken those words, the three warriors leaving Duryodhana\\'s side entered the great forest just as the sun was setting. While sitting under a large banian tree in the night, they saw an owl killing numerous crows one after another. At the sight of this, Aswatthaman, his heart full of rage at the thought of his father\\'s fate, resolved to slay the slumbering Panchalas. And wending to the gate of the camp, he saw there a Rakshasa of frightful visage, his head reaching to the very heavens, guarding the entrance. And seeing that Rakshasa obstructing all his weapons, the son of Drona speedily pacified by worship the three-eyed Rudra. And then accompanied by Kritavarman and Kripa he slew all the sons of Draupadi, all the Panchalas with Dhrishtadyumna and others, together with their relatives, slumbering unsuspectingly in the night. All perished on that fatal night except the five Pandavas and the great warrior Satyaki. Those escaped owing to Krishna\\'s counsels, then the charioteer of Dhrishtadyumna brought to the Pandavas intelligence of the slaughter of the slumbering Panchalas by the son of Drona. Then Draupadi distressed at the death of her sons and brothers and father sat before her lords resolved to kill herself by fasting. Then Bhima of terrible prowess, moved by the words of Draupadi, resolved, to please her; and speedily taking up his mace followed in wrath the son of his preceptor in arms. The son of Drona from fear of Bhimasena and impelled by the fates and moved also by anger discharged a celestial weapon saying, \\'This is for the destruction of all the Pandavas\\'; then Krishna saying. \\'This shall not be\\', neutralised Aswatthaman\\'s speech. Then Arjuna neutralised that weapon by one of his own. Seeing the wicked Aswatthaman\\'s destructive intentions, Dwaipayana and Krishna pronounced curses on him which the latter returned. Pandava then deprived the mighty warrior-in-chariot Aswatthaman, of the jewel on his head, and became exceedingly glad, and, boastful of their success, made a present of it to the sorrowing Draupadi. Thus the tenth Parva, called Sauptika, is recited. The great Vyasa hath composed this in eighteen sections. The number of slokas also composed (in this) by the great reciter of sacred truths is eight hundred and seventy. In this Parva has been put together by the great Rishi the two Parvas called Sauptika and Aishika.  \"After this hath been recited the highly pathetic Parva called Stri, Dhritarashtra of prophetic eye, afflicted at the death of his children, and moved by enmity towards Bhima, broke into pieces a statue of hard iron deftly placed before him by Krishna (as substitute of Bhima). Then Vidura, removing the distressed Dhritarashtra\\'s affection for worldly things by reasons pointing to final release, consoled that wise monarch. Then hath been described the wending of the distressed Dhritarashtra accompanied by the ladies of his house to the field of battle of the Kauravas. Here follow the pathetic wailings of the wives of the slain heroes. Then the wrath of Gandhari and Dhritarashtra and their loss of consciousness. Then the Kshatriya ladies saw those heroes,--their unreturning sons, brothers, and fathers,--lying dead on the field. Then the pacification by Krishna of the wrath of Gandhari distressed at the death of her sons and grandsons. Then the cremation of the bodies of the deceased Rajas with due rites by that monarch (Yudhishthira) of great wisdom and the foremost also of all virtuous men. Then upon the presentation of water of the manes of the deceased princes having commenced, the story of Kunti\\'s acknowledgment of Karna as her son born in secret. Those have all been described by the great Rishi Vyasa in the highly pathetic eleventh Parva. Its perusal moveth every feeling heart with sorrow and even draweth tears from the eyes. The number of sections composed is twenty-seven. The number of slokas is seven hundred and seventy-five.  \"Twelfth in number cometh the Santi Parva, which increaseth the understanding and in which is related the despondency of Yudhishthira on his having slain his fathers, brothers, sons, maternal uncles and matrimonial relations. In this Parva is described how from his bed of arrows Bhishma expounded various systems of duties worth the study of kings desirous of knowledge; this Parva expounded the duties relative to emergencies, with full indications of time and reasons. By understanding these, a person attaineth to consummate knowledge. The mysteries also of final emancipation have been expatiated upon. This is the twelfth Parva the favourite of the wise. It consists of three hundred and thirty-nine sections, and contains fourteen thousand, seven hundred and thirty-two slokas.  \"Next in order is the excellent Anusasana Parva. In it is described how Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, was reconciled to himself on hearing the exposition of duties by Bhishma, the son of Bhagirathi. This Parva treats of rules in detail and of Dharma and Artha; then the rules of charity and its merits; then the qualifications of donees, and the supreme ride-regarding gifts. This Parva also describes the ceremonials of individual duty, the rules of conduct and the matchless merit of truth. This Parva showeth the great merit of Brahmanas and kine, and unraveleth the mysteries of duties in relation to time and place. These are embodied in the excellent Parva called Anusasana of varied incidents. In this hath been described the ascension of Bhishma to Heaven. This is the thirteenth Parva which hath laid down accurately the various duties of men. The number of sections, in this is one hundred and forty-six. The number of slokas is eight thousand.  \"Then comes the fourteenth Parva Aswamedhika. In this is the excellent story of Samvarta and Marutta. Then is described the discovery (by the Pandavas) of golden treasuries; and then the birth of Parikshit who was revived by Krishna after having been burnt by the (celestial) weapon of Aswatthaman. The battles of Arjuna the son of Pandu, while following the sacrificial horse let loose, with various princes who in wrath seized it. Then is shown the great risk of Arjuna in his encounter with Vabhruvahana the son of Chitrangada (by Arjuna) the appointed daughter of the chief of Manipura. Then the story of the mongoose during the performance of the horse-sacrifice. This is the most wonderful Parva called Aswamedhika. The number of sections is one hundred and three. The number of slokas composed (in this) by Vyasa of true knowledge is three thousand, three hundred and twenty.  \"Then comes the fifteenth Parva called Asramvasika. In this, Dhritarashtra, abdicating the kingdom, and accompanied by Gandhari and Vidura went to the woods. Seeing this, the virtuous Pritha also, ever engaged in cherishing her superiors, leaving the court of her sons, followed the old couple. In this is described the wonderful meeting through the kindness of Vyasa of the king (Dhritarashtra) with the spirits of his slain children, grand-children, and other princes, returned from the other world. Then the monarch abandoning his sorrows acquired with his wife the highest fruit of his meritorious actions. In this Parva, Vidura after having leaned on virtue all his life attaineth to the most meritorious state.  \"The learned son of Gavalgana, Sanjaya, also of passions under full control, and the foremost of ministers, attained, in the Parva, to the blessed state. In this, Yudhishthira the just met Narada and heard from him about the extinction of the race of Vrishnis. This is the very wonderful Parva called Asramvasika. The number of sections in this is forty-two, and the number of slokas composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth is one thousand five hundred and six.  \"After this, you know, comes the Maushala of painful incidents. In this, those lion-hearted heroes (of the race of Vrishni) with the scars of many a field on their bodies, oppressed with the curse of a Brahmana, while deprived of reason from drink, impelled by the fates, slew each other on the shores of the Salt Sea with the Eraka grass which (in their hands) became (invested with the fatal attributes of the) thunder. In this, both Balarama and Kesava (Krishna) after causing the extermination of their race, their hour having come, themselves did not rise superior to the sway of all-destroying Time. In this, Arjuna the foremost among men, going to Dwaravati (Dwaraka) and seeing the city destitute of the Vrishnis was much affected and became exceedingly sorry. Then after the funeral of his maternal uncle Vasudeva the foremost among the Yadus (Vrishnis), he saw the heroes of the Yadu race lying stretched in death on the spot where they had been drinking. He then caused the cremation of the bodies of the illustrious Krishna and Balarama and of the principal members of the Vrishni race. Then as he was journeying from Dwaraka with the women and children, the old and the decrepit--the remnants of the Yadu race--he was met on the way by a heavy calamity. He witnessed also the disgrace of his bow Gandiva and the unpropitiousness of his celestial weapons. Seeing all this, Arjuna became despondent and, pursuant to Vyasa\\'s advice, went to Yudhishthira and solicited permission to adopt the Sannyasa mode of life. This is the sixteenth Parva called Maushala The number of sections is eight and the number of slokas composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth is three hundred and twenty.  \"The next is Mahaprasthanika, the seventeenth Parva.  \"In this, those foremost among men the Pandavas abdicating their kingdom went with Draupadi on their great journey called Mahaprasthana. In this, they came across Agni, having arrived on the shore of the sea of red waters. In this, asked by Agni himself, Arjuna worshipped him duly, returned to him the excellent celestial bow called Gandiva. In this, leaving his brothers who dropped one after another and Draupadi also, Yudhishthira went on his journey without once looking back on them. This the seventeenth Parva is called Mahaprasthanika. The number of sections in this is three. The number of slokas also composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth is three hundred and twenty.  \"The Parva that comes after this, you must know, is the extraordinary one called Svarga of celestial incidents. Then seeing the celestial car come to take him, Yudhishthira moved by kindness towards the dog that accompanied him, refused to ascend it without his companion. Observing the illustrious Yudhishthira\\'s steady adherence to virtue, Dharma (the god of justice) abandoning his canine form showed himself to the king. Then Yudhishthira ascending to heaven felt much pain. The celestial messenger showed him hell by an act of deception. Then Yudhishthira, the soul of justice, heard the heart-rending lamentations of his brothers abiding in that region under the discipline of Yama. Then Dharma and Indra showed Yudhishthira the region appointed for sinners. Then Yudhishthira, after leaving the human body by a plunge in the celestial Ganges, attained to that region which his acts merited, and began to live in joy respected by Indra and all other gods. This is the eighteenth Parva as narrated by the illustrious Vyasa. The number of slokas composed, O ascetics, by the great Rishi in this is two hundred and nine.  \"The above are the contents of the Eighteen Parvas. In the appendix (Khita) are the Harivansa and the Vavishya. The number of slokas contained in the Harivansa is twelve thousand.\"  These are the contents of the section called Parva-sangraha. Sauti continued, \"Eighteen Akshauhinis of troops came together for battle. The encounter that ensued was terrible and lasted for eighteen days. He who knows the four Vedas with all the Angas and Upanishads, but does not know this history (Bharata), cannot be regarded as wise. Vyasa of immeasurable intelligence, has spoken of the Mahabharata as a treatise on Artha, on Dharma, and on Kama. Those who have listened to his history can never bear to listen to others, as, indeed, they who have listened to the sweet voice of the male Kokila can never hear the dissonance of the crow\\'s cawing. As the formation of the three worlds proceedeth from the five elements, so do the inspirations of all poets proceed from this excellent composition. O ye Brahman, as the four kinds of creatures (viviparous, oviparous, born of hot moisture and vegetables) are dependent on space for their existence, so the Puranas depend upon this history. As all the senses depend for their exercise upon the various modifications of the mind, so do all acts (ceremonials) and moral qualities depend upon this treatise. There is not a story current in the world but doth depend on this history, even as body upon the food it taketh. All poets cherish the Bharata even as servants desirous of preferment always attend upon masters of good lineage. Even as the blessed domestic Asrama can never be surpassed by the three other Asramas (modes of life) so no poets can surpass this poem.  \"Ye ascetics, shake off all inaction. Let your hearts be fixed on virtue, for virtue is the one only friend of him that has gone to the other world. Even the most intelligent by cherishing wealth and wives can never make these their own, nor are these possessions lasting. The Bharata uttered by the lips of Dwaipayana is without a parallel; it is virtue itself and sacred. It destroyeth sin and produceth good. He that listeneth to it while it is being recited hath no need of a bath in the sacred waters of Pushkara. A Brahmana, whatever sins he may commit during the day through his senses, is freed from them all by reading the Bharata in the evening. Whatever sins he may commit also in the night by deeds, words, or mind, he is freed from them all by reading Bharata in the first twilight (morning). He that giveth a hundred kine with horns mounted with gold to a Brahmana well-posted up in the Vedas and all branches of learning, and he that daily listeneth to the sacred narrations of the Bharata, acquireth equal merit. As the wide ocean is easily passable by men having ships, so is this extensive history of great excellence and deep import with the help of this chapter called Parva sangraha.\"  Thus endeth the section called Parva-sangraha of the Adi Parva of the blessed Mahabharata.
